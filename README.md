# SOC-Study
A personal SOC study repository containing hands-on notes and repeatable operational artefacts built while training for entry-level SOC work. Includes triage templates/playbooks (e.g., phishing), investigation checklists, and practical write-ups focused on alert analysis, escalation decision-making, and clear documentation.
